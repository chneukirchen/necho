NAME
     necho, zecho, qecho, jecho, secho – minimal, sensible alternatives to
     echo(1)

SYNOPSIS
     necho [string ...]
     zecho [string ...]
     qecho [string ...]
     jecho [string ...]
     secho [string ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The necho utility writes its arguments, one per line, to standard output.

     The zecho utility writes its arguments, terminated by NUL bytes, to
     standard output.

     The qecho utility writes its arguments, surrounded by unicode quotation
     marks, to standard output.

     The jecho utility writes its arguments joined together to standard
     output.

     The necho utility writes its arguments, separated by spaces, to standard
     output, followed by a <newline>.  If there are no arguments, only the
     <newline> is written.

OPTIONS
     Implementations do not support any options, nor special handling of a
     “--” argument.

EXIT STATUS
     These utilities exit 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     echo(1), printf(1)

STANDARDS
     secho is a POSIX-conforming, but not XSI-conforming implementation of
     echo(1).
